# Legacy
 Greenfield project for RBK: NOABO 

## Prompt

we refactor  an exicted project using a new Technologie "Angular-10" and we extend it by implementing new features.
Our extended app will eventually display 6 views or more in the future with improving feature :


1. a **Home** component for presenting our website  .

2. a **LogIn** component for changement from signIn to signUp .

4. a **SignUp** component for registration .

5. an **event-made** component it will render the login otherwise the signup if you dont have an account
and it will confirm you certification number so you can register.
After all of that you will have the event post page that you can put all the information of your event
and there is the google map to specify the place of your event and you can post your event after clicking on add. 

6. an **event-customer** component : basically the same with the signup and login the difference is that in the signup he will choose 
his perferences(the categories of events he likes) so we can filter only those what he choosed on his profile .
he can comment(give his feedBack and give a suggestion and like /dislike the events)
